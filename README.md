More About the working of the project:

The Course Selection portal is a helpful domain for students to select and complete courses that 
were specified and entered by the professors. This portal aims to assist the students to make 
informed decisions by providing specific information about each course among the multiple 
courses and their domains. This makes it easier for the professors to access the portal, add and 
update the courses for the students which will be stored in the portal database. Further the 
database also stores the information of the user or student who has registered and also the details 
of teachers to keep track of the entire procedures. The course selection portal makes the entire 
process of updating and accessing the courses simple, easy and time saving for both the students 
and the professors. Students also have an advantage of being able to provide feedback about the 
courses which can help the teachers to improve and make the required changes in that particular 
course. Altogether the portal can be seen as a very useful platform in terms of skill development 
and as well as being user friendly.
